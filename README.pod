=head1 NAME

This is a port of L<Mojo::IOLoop> to L<AnyEvent> event framework;

=head1 AnyEvent?

L<AnyEvent> is coolest event loop available for perl. You want to
use it in your Mojo apps :)

=head1 Why should i care?

Becouse you get all the goodies that come with L<AnyEvent> (TLS, IPv6 support,
lots of modules) into your L<Mojolicious> webapps, or you get really cool
HTTP/1.1 websocket enabled http server/client (L<Mojo::Server::Daemon>, 
L<Mojo::Client>) if you want to incorporate some L<Mojo|Mojolicious> into
your L<AnyEvent> applications

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Put the following in B<myapp.pl>:

 #!/usr/bin/perl
 
 use strict;
 use warnings;
 
 use Mojolicious::Lite;

 get '/' => sub {
   my ($self) = @_;
 };
 
 # some AnyEvent stuff!
 get '/ae' => sub {
   my $self = shift;
   # already loaded, this for demonstration
   # purposes only, so that you can run
   # this app under normal mojo server to
   # find out that /ae location doesn't work 
   require AnyEvent;
 	
   my $delay = rand(1.3);
 	
   # delay response using AnyEvent timer:
   my $t = AnyEvent->timer(
 	 after => $delay,
     cb => sub {
       $self->render_data("Delayed response ($delay) by AnyEvent");
 	 },
   );
   
   # the same with AE api:
   # my $t = AE::timer(
   #   $delay, 0,
   #   sub {
   #     $self->render_data("Delayed response ($delay) by AnyEvent");
   #   }
   # );
 	
   # save timer to stash
   $self->stash(timer => $t);
 };
 
 # Start the Mojolicious command system
 app->start;

Just start your webapplication with B<daemon_anyevent> argument instead daemon:

 $ ./myapp.pl daemon_anyevent
